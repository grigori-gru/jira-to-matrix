The algorithm for creating a connection between a new task and the current one:

1. If the current task is an epic, a child task is created for the current epic.
2. If the task being created is a subtask, then a child task is created for the current task.
3. In the epic, you cannot create subtasks.
4. If the task being created is not a subtask and the current task is not epic, a connection `relates to` is created between the tasks
